# ttmAPI - Table Top Manager API

## Overview

This repository contains the backend implementation of the `ttmAPI`, an Employee Checkout System developed for a homebrewed table top role playing game system. The API is designed to manage and track users (players), character lists, characters, abilitites, and items.

### Key Features

- **Automatic Table and Data Management** The API will check if the necessary tables exist and create them. (This will eventually also include loading sample data for all tables.)
    - If tables do not exist, they will be created.
    - If tables exist - but are of a different structure, they will be modified.
    - If tables exist, and match current structure, the API will provide a success indicator.

- **More to Come**

### Note
- **Development and Testing:** This API is designed to be cloned and ran locally. There is no live server set up.
